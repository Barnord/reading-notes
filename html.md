# HTML

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>This is the title of the web page, appearing as the name in the tab on your browser</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Primary Heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        <h2>Secondary Heading</h2>
        <p>Another paragraph</p>
        <h2>A second Secondary Heading</h2>
    </body>
</html>
```
This is an example of a very basic HTML site, the entirety of the site must be contained within the ```<html></html>``` tags. Only items in the ```<body></body>``` tag are visible.

Most tags are paired with a closing tag, which is the same tag but with a forward slash in front of it.


### Target Audience
It's important to note who your site is for, and what demographics they belong to.

Try to design around what you think people visiting your site will want.
- motivations
- goals
- information
  - brand/area
  - product/service
  - what makes you unique

### Site Maintenance
Updating your site is good. How often you should update your site varies, when deciding how often to update it there are some things that would be good to track. If your site is for goods/services think about how often people return to the site, and how often are your stock/service/prices changing. For information, how often the subject is updated, and how often people will return to your site for more information.

### Site Design
It's good to start with a very basic site map, starting with the homepage, and a small web down to things you want to include/link to the homepage, and sub sections of those. Then you want to make a wireframe of each page on the site. A wire frame has elements roughly where you want them, and text at its proper size, but cannot be interacted with. Plan your content, make more important things pop out on the page, and put similar things together. Try to keep articles similar. People look at big and bright things first. Also people like pictures, so they tend to get noticed first.

## Html5 Layout
Many of the ID's and Class's you would put on div tags have just become their own tags for brevity's sake.
```
<nav></nav>
<article></article>
<aside></aside>
<footer></footer>
```
These are all examples of div tags. Div tags can have div tags in them, for example an article can have both a header and a footer, or an article might have several sections. The new div tags are largely used for orginization. 
```<span></span>``` Is an inline div element.

### Figures
```
<figure>
    <img src="images/adorable-puppies.jpg>
    <figcaption>Adorable Puppies</figcaption>
</figure>
```
Figures are great for showing or demonstrating things, and should always contain a figcaption.

### Comments
To comment in HTML use ```<!-- comment here -->```
