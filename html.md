# HTML

```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>This is the title of the web page, appearing as the name in the tab on your browser</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Primary Heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        <h2>Secondary Heading</h2>
        <p>Another paragraph</p>
        <h2>A second Secondary Heading</h2>
    </body>
</html>
```
This is an example of a very basic HTML site, the entirety of the site must be contained within the ```<html></html>``` tags. Only items in the ```<body></body>``` tag are visible.

Most tags are paired with a closing tag, which is the same tag but with a forward slash in front of it.


## Target Audience
It's important to note who your site is for, and what demographics they belong to.

Try to design around what you think people visiting your site will want.
- motivations
- goals
- information
  - brand/area
  - product/service
  - what makes you unique

## Site Maintinenance
Updating your site is good. How often you should update your site varies, when deciding how often to update it there are some things that would be good to track. If your site is for goods/services think about how often people return to the site, and how often are your stock/service/prices changing. For information, how often the subject is updated, and how often people will return to your site for more information.

## Site Design
It's good to start with a very basic site map, starting with the homepage, and a small web down to things you want to include/link to the homepage, and sub sections of those. Then you want to make a wireframe of each page on the site. A wire frame has elements roughly where you want them, and text at its proper size, but cannot be interacted with.
