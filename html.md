```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>This is the title of the web page, appearing as the name in the tab on your browser</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Primary Heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        <h2>Secondary Heading</h2>
        <p>Another paragraph</p>
        <h2>A second Secondary Heading</h2>
    </body>
</html>
```
This is an example of a very basic HTML site, the entirety of the site must be contained within the ```<html></html>``` tags. Only items in the ```<body></body>``` tag are visible.

Most tags are paired with a closing tag, which is the same tag but with a forward slash in front of it.
