Hello, me Ben. This my page for learning-notes.

### Growth Mindset

To me the Growth Mindset appears to be largely letting go of negative emotions that hold you back. When you're frustrated, take a quick break to cool off. When you're jealous of someone else's success or accomplishments, think instead of how your skillsets could potentially complement each other.

* Keep a positive outlook
- When you're struggling, either take a break or switch to a different task for a while
* Always look for area's you can improve in
