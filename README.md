# Reading Notes

Hello, my name is Ben Arno, and this is where I will be keeping some notes for my code fellows bootcamps. You can find my Github Portfolio [here](https://github.com/Barnord).

### Growth Mindset

To me the ***Growth Mindset*** appears to be largely letting go of negative emotions that hold you back. When you're frustrated, *take a quick break to cool off.* When you're jealous of someone else's success or accomplishments, *think instead of how your skillsets could potentially complement each other.*

##### How I try to keep a ***Growth Mindset***

* Keep a positive outlook
- When you're struggling, either take a break or switch to a different task for a while
* Always look for area's you can improve in
