# Readings: React 1

## ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview

So far the only new information was key/property and method definition shorthand. I'm pretty sure I've seen it and already forgotten though.

I saw extends in react and wasn't entirely sure of what it meant, but now I am after seeing it called out here, and working with extending classes in dotnet.

I don't think promises were covered on their own in the new 301, but my final project group learned about `Promise.all()` and did our best to abuse it.

## React - Hello World

We didn't actually mess with ReactDOM in 301, so this could be interesting.

Unless this whole article is a foreword.

## React - JSX

I didn't realize how much JSX was doing, converting everything from some weird JS/HTML hybrid into regular JS. Very cool.

## React - Rendering Elements

This one is entirely review from 301.

## React - Components and Props

I recall John saying that everyone was using functions in React anymore (it's methods cause react is OOP, isn't it? Maybe not everything still says function. Will learn more about it later) and there appear to be some basic examples of that in here, which I hadn't been exposed to, so that's cool. Apparently they are functions still according to the end of this article.

## React - State & Lifecycle

I had never seen the `componentWillUnmount()` method before, so that's something to read into. More review in this article though.
