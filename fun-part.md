## Logical Operators

Logical Operators allow you to compare two comparison operators, they are ```&&``` and ```||```

```&&``` is and, and ```||``` is or.
```
((5 > 2) && (2 < 3))
```

## Loops
Loops are composed of a keyword, a condition, and the code you want the loop to execute.

### For
For runs a code a certain number of times. The condition is usually a counter to tell how many times the loop runs.

### While
Runs while the condition resolves to true, will run infinitely if condition is simply set to true, and not at all if condition is set to false.

### Do While
Similar to the while loop, but will always execute at least once. If condition is set to true, will run infinitely, if condition is set to false, will run once.
