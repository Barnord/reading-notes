# What Google learned from its quest to build the perfect team

## The Man wants us to work together, man.

In our data saturated lives, studies have shown that working in cohesive groups causes the whole to innovate faster, find better solutions, and cause people to be happier in their jobs. All this causes higher profits. Better employees rotated dining companions, and better managers had good communication, and avoided micromanagement.

## Group Norms

I made this heading three paragraphs ago and all those paragraphs have really said is that they're important. 

Seems like they're trying to say a willingness to work together is the most important thing now.

Two norms stood out in a series of experiments, firstly, all members communicated similar amounts. Operating off of a small portion of the group makes you group-dumb. Secondly, good teams were better at intuiting how others felt based on nonverbal factors.

## Psychological Safety

Seems to be largely a lack of percieved judgement from other team members. Good communication and a willingness to open up are key.
