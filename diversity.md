# Diversity & Inclusion

## When Women Stopped Coding
1. At the same time the number of women in computer science started decreasing, personal computers started being marketed towards men and boys.
2. When women tried to enter computer science fields their knowledge of computers was behind that of their male counterparts, because women hadn't been playing on computers as much as men.

## Employees of Tech
1. Tech is male dominated.
2. While many of these companies are composed primarily of white people, this is usually less so than I would expect from the percentage of white people in the US.
3. White people are represented much more in the top 50 US companies than I would have thought.

## Why Diversity Matters
1. Diversity efforts are most successful when they're driven by a commitment from company leaders.
2. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse userbase.
3. Youtube's iOS app was made by right handed people, causing an estimated 5-10% of videos uploaded through it to be uploaded upside down.
