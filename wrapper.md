# Wrapper Classes

## What is a Wrapper Class?
A wrapper class is a class that 'wraps' around one or more other classes, often hiding the complexity of the base classes. The wrapper class does so by invoking the base class and processing/formatting the results.

## Why Wrap?
Wrapper classes are most useful when interacting with third party services, where you can't guarantee you're going to get all the data back. As such, wrapper classes typically contain a Try/Catch/Finally block.
