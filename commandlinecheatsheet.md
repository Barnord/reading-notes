#### What's the difference between a text editor and an IDE?

A text editor is primarily a place to create text for whatever reason, different editors have different features, but the main things to look out for are:
- Code Completion
- syntax highlighting
- a variety of themes (color schemes for the editor itself)
- access to a wide variety of extensions

A text editor doesn't need to have all, or even any of those things, but they do greatly increase the quality of life for users. The primary function of a text editor is to allow you to type, and edit, text. An IDE does all of that and more, such as allowing you to compile and debug code.


#### The REAL Cheatsheet
**Linux is case sensitive**
- echo $SHELL = tells you what shell you're using (in our case bash)
- pwd = Print Working Directory, tells you which file you're working out of
- ls = list, lists things.
 - -l = long listing, indicates if file/directory, owner of the item, parent directory, file size, modification time, and item name
 - /etc = lists our current directories contents
 -  -a lists hidden items as well
- ~ = shortcut for our home folder, in my case c/users/gordn
- . = current directory, if I were in Documents, . would be c/users/gordn/documents
- .. = parent directory, if I were in Documents, .. would be c/users/gordn
- cd = Change Directory, moves you to a different directory, excellent time to use the last three inputs to this list
- file = gives information about the file you point the command to

to interact with a directory with spaces in the name use quotes (single or double) or type a backslash before the space
a . before a file or folder indicates that that item is hidden, .file.txt would be a hidden file.
