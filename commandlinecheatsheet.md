####What's the difference between a text editor and an IDE?

A text editor is primarily a place to create text for whatever reason, different editors have different features, but the main things to look out for are:
- Code Completion
- syntax highlighting
- a variety of themes (color schemes for the editor itself)
- access to a wide variety of extensions

A text editor doesn't need to have all, or even any of those things, but they do greatly increase the quality of life for users. The primary function of a text editor is to allow you to type, and edit, text. An IDE does all of that and more, such as allowing you to compile and debug code.
