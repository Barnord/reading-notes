# Javascript

To put javascript on a page use the script element in html. ```<script src="file.js"></script>```

## Scripts
They end with a semicolon.
```
/* This is how you make multiline comments in js. */

// This is how you make single-line comments
```
It's good to make plenty of notes to let other people know what your code does.

## Variables

```
var quantity; // This makes a variable named quantity.

quantity = 3; // This assigns the value 3 to the variable quantity.
```
You can also assign the value 3 to quantity as you delcare the variable.


You can declare multiple variables in one line by seperating them with a comma.
```
var cost = 7, quantity = 3;
```

In JS variables are case sensitive.
